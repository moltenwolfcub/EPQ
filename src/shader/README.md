# Shaders

This package is a direct port of [shaders.go](https://github.com/moltenwolfcub/gogl-utils/blob/master/shaders.go) from the gogl-utils package I wrote.

The reason I'm porting it here rather than just importing it, is that I need it in openGL 4.6 and I can't be bothered to change all my other projects that currently use 3.3. It probably wouldn't be much work and I might change it in the future but for now I'm just copy+pasting it here
