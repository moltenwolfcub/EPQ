## Shaders
Wrote a more advanced shader to make lighting more realistic over objects. This version made use of the Phong lighting model where a fragment gets it's colour based off of diffuse, specular and ambient components of the reflected light. Most of this was adapted from this tutorial online: https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Basic-Lighting

This is currently hard-coded into shaders rather than dynamically read from the worldState but hopefully I can implement that next.

I might eventually swap from the Phong lighting system to a Physically Based Rendering system for increased realism on the lighting but this will work for now.
