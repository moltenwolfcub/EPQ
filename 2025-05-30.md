# Project Work
## Models
Successfully loaded and rendered models into openGL. This took a lot of work and time working out all the nuance of the CGO interface and assimp's complexities. Also had to spend a lot of time setting up the embedding and loading of textures to the project. 

I wrote a parser for the assimp Scene to convert it to my own model data structure. This was then sent to openGL to render on the GPU with a shader reading all the vertex and texture data.

Roughly followed this tutorial https://learnopengl.com/Model-Loading/Model but did a lot to make it work myself in my specific go environment.
