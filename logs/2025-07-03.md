# Project work
## Refactor
It was becoming very easy for the project to get an unhealthy level of coupling between concerns. I realised this when the camera needed 2 different representations because one is used for rendering and the other for it's world state representation. This led me to the decision to move all the rendering code into a separate package. This allows for very a very explicit definition of what can and can't be coupled together.
