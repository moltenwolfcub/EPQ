# Project work
## Player model
Fixed the player model designed on [[2025-05-14]] by swapping the mesh to use weight groups to attach to the bones rather than raw blender parenting. I then imported it into the project and it mostly worked. The right side of his body is currently weirdly inverted but it's most of the way there.

## Animations
Fixed a bug with animations. The uniforms that controlled the animations are global to all models. If one model set an animation and the next one drawn didn't set its own animation (because it wasn't meant to be animated) it would still read the uniform and apply a weird animation meant for a different model.

I now have an explicit check for whether a model should read from this uniform fixing this.
