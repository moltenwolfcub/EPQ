## Libraries
#### Assimp
Assimp is a model loader that's used to import complex 3d models and animations from various file formats into a uniform code structure that can be easily passed through to OpenGL.

It is written in C and I've found some bindings written for Go (https://github.com/raedatoui/assimp) however I'm not entirely sure if I want to use them because they haven't been updated for a few years. It depends on how much the public API has changed since then.

## CGO
I've also spent some time looking into CGO (https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) and how it works in calling and using C libraries like assimp from Go code. This could be a good alternative to using the go bindings for assimp and instead allow me to write my own as I go. The real trouble is making sure all the packages get properly linked while compiling the go project.
