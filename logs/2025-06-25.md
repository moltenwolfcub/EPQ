# Project work
## Animated models
Figured out how to import my own animated models into the project. So far I'd just been using the one I got from the tutorial I was following but now I've figured out how to import my animations from blender. The main problem I'd previously had was that I wasn't using weight groups to bind the blender meshes to the bones.

I tested several different kinds of animations including ones with multiple animations. Eventually I'm going to add functionality to swap between animations.
