# Project work
## Testing
Set up the framework to allow me to create automated tests for the project. Getting tests working was relatively simple but getting the GitHub actions to properly integrate took a while because of all the C dependencies that needed to be installed on the GitHub test server. Now the few tests that are already written are ran on a push and will automatically detect if the commit causes any breaking changes
