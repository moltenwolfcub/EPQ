# Project Work
## Model embedding
Implemented the code to allow the go executable to embed the model data of model files into itself. This required writing my own C interface to pass the model files into assimp. Due to assimp being a C (and C++) library it takes C types in most of its functions and, because I am using a non-standard method of model loading, I needed to create a custom implementation of a C type to pass through to assimp. This required a lot of CGO setup, C code and complex compiler and linker setup.

The end result of this work was that the models are now properly embedded in the executable which allows the built project to run on any computer as a stand-alone file rather than having to distribute all the models along with the executable and store them in the appropriate relative location.

# Learning
## CGO
I had to do a lot of research into cgo's methods for interfacing with go back from C. I'd previously used C functions from go but now I had the issue of exporting go methods to C headers to send data the other direction. Main documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo

## C
I had to learn how to write code in C - which is a very unfamiliar programming language to me. The main bulk of the code involved learning the specifics of implementing my own file system to pass through the embedded file system from go. With the help of assimp's source code (https://github.com/assimp/assimp) and a book on the C programming language (The C Programming Language. 2nd Edition - Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie), I managed to figure out enough of the language to implement my functionality.

I also had to do a significant bit of learning surrounding memory-safety as I am typically used to using garbage collected languages. Concepts like malloc and free were unfamiliar to me and required a bit of getting my head around. I eventually managed to get rid of all potential memory leaks (to my current knowledge) from the C code.
