## CGO
Continued to look into how CGO works with compiling C programs by trying to write a program that imports assimp. This has been partially successful as I have managed to get the project to load assimp but I have faced struggles in trying to get the C++ standard library to install alongside assimp to make most of the functionality work. I can only access constants at the moment.

## C++
Wrote a sample program in C++ to prove to myself that assimp was installed correctly and worked when coding in its native language. Through this, I've managed to trace the issue to the linking process during Cgo's compilation. I now just need to setup my linker settings correctly so that it will compile and retrieve the correct standard libraries.
