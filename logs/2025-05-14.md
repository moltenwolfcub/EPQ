#### Model Loading
I haven't done any work within openGL importing 3d models into scenes as opposed to primitive meshes. I spent some time reading over openGL docs and several tutorials:
- https://learnopengl.com/Model-Loading/Assimp
From here, I learned the theory of how to import 3d files into an openGL project but still needed to spend some time learning how to adapt it to work within the Go workspace and with my specific bindings.

I then wanted to look into how I can import blender rigged animations into projects and found more tutorials/documentation on how to do these things

# Project Work
## 3d models
Within blender, I started creating a basic model for a character. This wouldn't be anything fancy or good-looking. It would just be a primitive prototype designed to prove it woks without having to worry about intricate modelling.

I imported a character rig from previous projects I've done in blender. The original rig came from my adaptation of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBYb1YmaOMY. This is a nice simple rig that takes full advantage of Blender's inverse kinematic solver for realistic joints.

I then created a basic model to attach to the rig out of simple cubes. I then spent a bit of time creating a simple animation just to test out the character's bone structure and ensure the rig worked correctly to control the character.
