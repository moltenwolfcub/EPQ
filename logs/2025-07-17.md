# Project work
## Movement
Rewrote the whole movement system to use velocity and acceleration values. Now, rather than directly moving the player anywhere, the player is given an acceleration for the current frame which it applies to its existing velocity and updates its position accordingly. This allows for a more realistic system that mimics real world forces better and provides a sense of inertia instead of the previous on/off movement in the force.

This new system was then used to implement gravity into the world so now the player can fall. I had to create a flying state for the player too as there is no collision detection yet and if the player just fell, there would be no way to do anything.
