# Project work
## Maintenance + Performance
Spent a bit of time fixing up parts of the project that had become a bit messy. Restructured quite a bit of the project and corrected privacy of several structs.

I also spent some time looking into the performance loss in build time due to the introduction of cgo and managed to isolate all the references to C into 1 package which allows the build to cache that data rather than recompiling from c++ every build. This took build times from around 15 seconds down closer to 3 seconds
