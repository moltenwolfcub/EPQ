## 3d models
Created a basic run animation for the player. This took a lot of work and research into human anatomy and how people run. I tried downloading existing run cycles and applying them to my model but nothing came back fruitful so I resorted back to doing it myself and spent time using myself as a reference to create a semi-realistic running animation.
