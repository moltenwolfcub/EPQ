# Project work
## Backwards continuity
Implemented a function to return the functionality of using primitive shapes within the render engine. Since adding the functionality to import models in from files, primitives couldn't be easily imported so I created a function that generates primitives in the new format. I doubt these will have any use in the final project but it might help with debugging and keeps continuity with previous commits of the project.

## Rigged models
Started looking at imported rigged and animated models into the engine. I created a simpler model than the player model to test with and imported it with the existing system. This didn't work properly yet as all the bones are getting drawn at the model's origin rather than getting the correct offset from the bone matrix.
