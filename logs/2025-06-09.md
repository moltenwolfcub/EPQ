## Bone data
Wrote the code to manage the structure of a bone hierarchy attached to models. This is the core framework attached to models that will be used to animate the models. These bones hold a set of keyframes that dictate how they should be animated and then the bones will be used to generate transformation matricies for the verticies associated with the model by a weight map.
