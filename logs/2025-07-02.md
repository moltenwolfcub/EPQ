## Player
Set up the player as its own object that can be controlled independently from the rest of the world. Then changed the camera controls so that it's locked to the player and the player's movement is now controlled by WASD. There is also an optional free camera mode that can be toggled with TAB.

## Camera
A long standing weird problem I had was that the camera was always at a negative coordinate compared to its world state representation. I discovered a weird phenomenon as to how the rendering and movement works. As the camera's view matrix is being applied to all the world objects instead of the camera position (which has to be fixed in this render situation), we're actually moving the world around relative to the camera instead of the the camera relative to the world. Moving the world left appears as moving right to the camera so everything was inverted. Now I'm negating the camera position when calculating the view matrix and all the coordinates work as expected within the world state.
