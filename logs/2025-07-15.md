# Project work
## Animations
Implemented the code to handle switching between multiple different player animations based on different conditions so now the idle animation plays while the player is stationary and the running one starts when there is movement.

To make this look better I then made the player rotate in the direction he is moving and synced his movement speed to the animation speed to make it look like the character is actually walking rather than having a disjointed animation and glide around in 3d space.

## Materials
Fixed a couple bugs with the normals in the player's lighting and also slightly changed the player's material.

Also updated the general shader so that it can now support emmision textures which allows for more options when designing models.
