# Project Work
## Camera
Set up an isometric camera. Spent a lot of time working through the maths for orthographic projection matrices and finally managed to set one up that behaves like I intended. I then finished up the isometric with the right rotation matrices. This required researching and refreshing my knowledge on some more linear algebra so that I could construct the necessary view matrix with the 3d rotations are applied in the correct order. After I got this working, I precomputed and premultiplied the matrices to anticipate future performance issues

# Research
## Isometric movement
Spent some time playing games with isometric perspectives to get a feel for the sort of controls that exist in games that are already made
