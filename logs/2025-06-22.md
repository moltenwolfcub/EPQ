## Shaders
Dynamically loaded the material properties from the model files. Either a texture map or a constant value will be present in the material file for a model. The code figures out which of the 2 is present and should be used. It's then passed to the shader for it to be rendered along with necessary texture coordinates to map the textures to verticies. This now allows model files to hold all the rendering information rather than having to put colours in the shader.

Implemented gamma correction in the shader to adjust the brightness and contrast to match human perception of light instead of the raw values outputted from the computer. This converts the linear space colours to the sRGB that our eyes can percieve.
