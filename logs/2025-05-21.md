## Pure C impl of assimp
Wrote a link into assimp written only in C rather than C++. This resulted in an identical error to the one I'd experienced while trying to compile the go code. After some research, I decided to try using the g++ compiler instead of the gcc one and this time it behaved perfectly and ran as expected. The problem is that go is compiling the C code with the wrong compiler so it doesn't have access to C++ Standard library that assimp requires to run correctly. I now know there's a way to run assimp through a pure C interface (so go will be able to call those functions) but I just need to get go and the linker to use the correct compiler for the C code.

## Go version
I spent some time reading through several forums and a lot of documentation until I finally managed to get the CGO header to function and compile. Now zlib is properly linked into the final binary along with assimp which allows the code to finally compile successfully. It also now uses the G++ compiler and linker rather than the GCC one which was causing it to lack libstdc++ and not compile. Now the framework for using openGL in go is pretty much set up and ready to use.
