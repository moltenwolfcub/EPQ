# Ideas
After some thought, I think I'm going to pursue my 2nd idea from [[2025-05-09]] about the isometric, ARPG game.
# Research
Spent some time researching libraries and implementation details that could be used to build the engine for the game.
## Libraries
#### OpenGL
The core rendering engine responsible for most of the 3d, shader work. I chose it because it is very stripped back and basic allowing for the maximum customisation by me.
#### MGL (Math GL)
A library responsible for managing the vector and matrix maths behind 3d games and rendering.
#### SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
A simple library that interacts with the raw hardware to allow for window creation and keyboard and mouse input. I've spent some time deliberating over using SDL2 or SDL3 but I think I've settled on using the older SDL2 due to having better support and that I am more familiar with it. There is also the factor that SDL3 has some Go bindings but they don't appear entirely complete and it has a different API to the one that I'm familiar with.
### Go Versions
The game is going to be developed in Go because it's a modern, up-to-date language and it's one that I'm familiar with coding 3d projects in. It's a compiled language which will make final packaging easier.

Most of the 3D libraries listed above are written for C so I've had to find some Go bindings or alternatives listed below.

## Implementation Details
### Isometric camera
There were 2 main approaches I thought about going with to make the isometric camera:
- A 2d renderer for the 3d world creating 2d hexagonal tiles.
- A 3d renderer with a fixed camera angle and an orthographic camera

After looking at the software I had used before and where I felt comfortable working, I decided to go with the 2nd approach of a 3d renderer. This approach would take much less boilerplate work from me which the alternative of writing my entire own 2d isometric renderer would involve. Especially when OpenGL provides an easy way of doing 3D graphics.

MGL provides a nice simple way of setting up an orthographic frustum. To achieve this isometric look.
