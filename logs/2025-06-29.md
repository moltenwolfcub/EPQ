# Project work
## Normal debugger
Implemented a shader to show the normals of a model to assist with debugging models and their problems. This included the use of a geometry shader on top of the usual fragment and vertex shader so I had to change a bit of the shader engine.
## Player model
Fixed the player model by applying the rotation and scale to all the bones which showed that blender had inverted the right side of the body's normals in the process of flipping the left side. This was easily fixed with a normal recalculation in blender and this also made the player look normal in the project.

## Shader loader
Refactored the entire shader loader. Removed a bunch of redundant fields and created a general system that can load any type of shader. This allows the same shader struct to store the ones with geometry shaders attached to them aswell rather than needing separate data types.
