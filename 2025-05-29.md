## Render pipeline
Spent a lot of time reading through OpenGL docs and the learnopengl website to familiarise myself with the render pipeline used to draw objects. I consolidated all my knowledge and now have a firm grasp on the order of processes, flow of data, what each of the buffers do and how it all comes together. I am now much better situated to continue working on nuanced bits of this engine.
## Lighting and shaders
Spent some time reading up on how shaders can be designed to encapsulate all the details found in realistic lighting. This involved understanding a lot of complicated maths. I now have a slightly better understanding of the different parts of lighting, what they do and how I can create them. I also looked into how I could implement HDR lighting and PRB materials which look quite advanced but something I might have a look at once I've got a working game.

# Project Work
## Mesh data struct
Created a data structure and importer for a mesh from assimp. This will hold all the important information we need to extract from the assimp data structure and manage drawing and buffers. Pretty much just a copy of this tutorial https://learnopengl.com/Model-Loading/Mesh made to work in go.
