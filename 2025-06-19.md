# Project work
## SSBOs
Implemented the better approach of managing passing bones into the shaders through shader storage buffer objects. This required rewriting a lot of the vertex generation code from assimp and the draw code. This rewrite has made the code base cleaner to reason with and will hopefully leave more freedom for me when creating models in blender
