# Project work
## Light types
Changed a single generic light to support multiple lights of different types. Inspired by this tutorial: https://learnopengl.com/Lighting/Light-casters
- Point lights have an attenuation where they emit light in all directions and it decays over distance.
- Directional lights emit a light from a single direction for an infinite distance. These will light any object in the scene regardless of position.
- Spot lights are like point lights however they only work in a set angular range creating the spot.

These lights have a Go representation in the world state and also a GLSL representation to be interpreted by the shader.

## Shaders
Added the animation code from the assimp animated vertex shader into the lighting shader so that it can now be changed to the general shader that can be used by any model. None of the other shaders are necessary anymore because they've all been encapsulated into this one. A couple of the simpler ones have, however, been kept for debugging purposes.
