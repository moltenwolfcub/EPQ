# Project work
## Debugging
Spent time debugging the shader and the code in go. I eventually traced the source of the issue and found several problems. The verticies weren't actually being saved to the model after their weights and assosiated bones were applied so those fields were empty. The fields were also being written to with incorrect values as the result of a typo. There was also an error with 64-bit vs 32-bit integers across the languages

## Cleanup
Removed some of the messy artefacts left in the code from following the C++ tutorials. C++ has different idiomatic ways to go so swapped out various methods and coding structures to better match go.

Ported OpenGL to 4.6 from the prior 3.3. This will hopefully produce a performance boost along with some newer features that allow me to increase readability between shader draw calls and go. This removing gogl-utils as a dependency and integrating it directly into the project so that it functioned with 4.6.
