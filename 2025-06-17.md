# Project work
## Cleanup
Cleaned up the code that manages the worldstate because it had grown very messy as a result of implementing animations that some models had and others didn't. This is now much cleaner and will make the project easier to work in.

# Research
## SSBOs
The current implementation of shaders is a bit unclear as an ivec4 is being used to pass in an array of 4 integers rather than some equivelant of a go slice in glsl. I spent some time reading and found shader storage buffer objects that fulfil this requirement and should allow me to pass in as many bones as necessary to 1 vertex and leaves the code more intuative and readable
