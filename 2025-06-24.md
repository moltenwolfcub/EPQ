# Project work
## Performance
The length of time to build and run the application had become ridiculous at this point. From when it took a couple miliseconds it now took 15 seconds for a build and about 3.5 seconds to load up and run. The main culprit for this was the model loading.
### Simple enhancements
- Swapped several lists to maps in the model loading code. This reduces lookup time complexity from O(n) to O(1).
- Changed keyframe lookup algorithm to binary search from linear search. The list is already sorted so this is a free upgrade that changes the time complexity from O(n) to O(logn).
- Changed as many methods as possible to pass by reference instead of pass by value because passing around large data structures takes a lot of processor power.
- Preallocated as many arrays as possible to take pressure off of the garbage collector and the memory allocator. `append()` calls malloc every time the backing array gets extended so if I can get a heuristic for the final size of the array, only 1 malloc is necessary to set the array size and save CPU cycles and thus load time
### Profiled enhancements
I then hit a brick wall for changes I knew to make to improve performance so I implemented a profiler to monitor where the CPU spent most of its time loading the project. Using this I managed to track down the main problems.
- I was manually flipping my textures vertically to make them line up with my UV coordinates. This was very expensive because all the reading and writing to texture arrays took several milliseconds. Assimp has built in functionality for flipping UVs so there's no reason for me doing it. Swapping to this saved 440ms on launch time.
- Changed texture loader. GO's built-in image.decode works but it's expensive on time and isn't the most efficient. I swapped to use SDL_IMAGE to load textures for the performance benefit. This saves 110ms on launch time.
- One of the most expensive parts of the loading process was the CGO call to assimp loading in the model. This can't be avoided however I was doing it twice on each model: once for the model and once for the animations. Now I am saving the assimp version of the model in my model data structure to allow it to be read by the animation later on. This saves the redundant second call to assimp and saves 440ms on launch time
### Failed Ideas
- I separated out all the openGL calls so that my model loading was thread safe. I tried asynchronously loading my models on separate threads to allow for parallel processing. This worked however the profiler said it ended up being slower. I'm assuming that the overhead of setting up and launching the separate threads is more than the time actually spent processing. I discarded the parallel processing idea after this. I did however keep the separated openGL calls as that provided a slight performance boost
- I tried batching all the openGL texture and buffer creation hoping that less calls to openGL and in turn CGO would reduce the amount of processing time however it didn't result in enough of a gain and the result of the change obfuscated the code so much that the readability would suffer. I reverted this change as a result
### Bottlenecks
The biggest chunk of time is spent on all the CGO calls. These are unavoidable because all the libraries I'm using are written in C with a go interface into them. CGO is notoriously slow and the biggest advice for improving performance is not to use it. If I didn't want to use it, my only options would be to rewrite the whole project in C or C++ or to rewrite/find a version of my libraries written in pure go; I've already done enough research to know that there aren't any pure go versions of the libraries written and it's out of the scope of this project to rewrite them myself (and frankly, I'd lose motivation for the project if I tried). The few seconds of performance loss are worth it for not having to rewrite entire libraries.

### Results
As a result of all these changes, I've managed to improve launch time performance by 1240ms (which is a lot). It now takes about 1.11s to launch the program.![[PerformanceFlameGraph.png]]

### Build time
Due to the use of CGO, there isn't much I can do about build time because 92% of the time is spent in the linker process when the C libraries are getting linked into the go program. One benefit of Go is that it doesn't rebuild packages that haven't been changed so if I don't touch my model package, which is expensive in its use of CGO, I can keep build times at a managable 4 seconds.
