## 3d models
I spent some time creating my own model to import with assimp. This was partly as a proof of concept that I am capable of importing my own models from blender into openGL. I created a small square of terrain with a varied height to look like hills and valleys. I then spent a bit of time creating interesting materials in blender's node-based shader editor.

My implementation of assimp currently only functions with textures so I had to spend a bit of time learning to bake materials into textures so that blender could export pointers to the images in the mlt file rather than passing through fixed values. This was easy enough and I ended up with a set of textures alongside my mlt and obj files after a bit of fiddling with export settings.

The last adjustment I had to make was to allow the shader that processes these textures to work on transparency by discarding fragments below a certain alpha threshold.
