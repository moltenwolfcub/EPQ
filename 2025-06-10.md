## Animator
Created an animator that handles interpolation and updating the bone structure based off of the loaded keyframes to regenerate the matricies for the next frame. Couldn't get this to work with the relevant shader though and the screen is showing as blank.

## Tools - Shader Debugger
Spent some time looking into various shader debuggers to find one that suited my needs and would allow me to debug my problem with the model not rendering. I eventually settled with RenderDoc which was very plug and play and allowed me to see the exact values passed through the GPU throughout each frame's render pass to allow me to understand what is actually happening to the model and why I can't see it
